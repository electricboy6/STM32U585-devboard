# IRIS (Integrated Rocket Intelligence System)


This project was made for blueprint, an event ran by Hack Club. Hack Club is a global nonprofit that runs events like this, where teenagers learn valuable skills, like hardware design and programming. You can learn more about my project on the blueprint site, at [my project page](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/projects/486).
