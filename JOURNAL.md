## 10/13/2025 5 PM - Started making the schemcatic  

I started to make the schematic for my board. It's taking way longer than I though it would, partially because there's just so many darn decoupling capacitors! It's really annoying. It didn't help that there's a 350 page datasheet that I have to read for the microcontroller I'm using. I also have no idea whatsoever if I'm doing this correctly, so that's going to be fun when I realize that it's all wrong.

Here's the work I got done so far:

I also had to learn how to use KiCad and everything, since this is my first hardware project ever. I probably picked something a bit too ambitious.

Oh by the way I worked for about an hour before making the project on here, so that's why there's the time discrepancy.
  

## 10/13/2025 8 PM - Worked on reading docs more, also worked more on schematic  

I finally got dark mode in KiCad working (my eyes are better already), and I worked some on figuring out what oscillator to use and how to hook it up. I've also decided that I'm going to redo the boot circuit, since I don't want to use a switch and instead want to use a button. I ran out of time tonight to do that, so I'm calling it here.
Here's part of the schematic (now in dark mode!):

## 10/23/2025 12 PM - Started to add in the sensors  

Well, I started to add in the sensors to the schematic. That is making it way bigger and kind of hard to fit everything, but it'll be ok I guess. I'm denfinitely going to need someone to review this schematic before I start routing, because this is my first time making a pcb, like I said earlier. I mostly know what I'm doing, but I don't know if it's correct. It's been really hard to read the datasheet for the stm, because each pin does so many things and it's hard to figure out which pin is the right one for what I need. For example, i2c1_sda seems to be lots of different pins but none of them are dedicated to being i2c1_sda? Is there something I'm going to need to do to make it use the pin as i2c1_sda? I don't know, and that's worrying me.

I'm pausing for a bit while I lock in on my homework.

Here's what my schematic looks like now:

## 10/23/2025 3 PM - Git integration + started mostfet work  

I'm getting it set up so that I can do this on my laptop while we're driving, so I should be able to make a bunch of progress then. This is also a test to see if my journal gets fixed, since its currently empty (??).
Git was going absolutely crazy while I was doing it (I've actually never used cli git before, I'm spoiled by JetBrains).

## 10/23/2025 9 PM - Spent way too much time trying to figure things out  

I've been working on the mosfet control for the pyro channels, and I spent like 1-1.5 hours trying to figure out how to do it. Thanks to scooter y for actually helping me figure it out, and I also worked on part selection a bit. I had originally planned the project for being just a devboard, but I realized I would run out of time to make the actual flight computer if I didn't just do it now. Because of that, some of my original parts (ldo especially) won't work, and I need to pick new ones.
Here's the new mosfet schematics:

## 10/26/2025 - Switched regulators, researched crystals and rf, organized  

Since I switched to just making the flight computer, the original ldo wasn't going to work (not a high enough max voltage input), so I switched to a switching power supply (mpm3610).

![newregulator.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTcwOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a99760a4d11d7d6de69536486b96f5bcbb93df3a/newregulator.png)

I also worked on researching which crystals I'm going to need to use (4mHz and 32.768kHz, figuring out the actual part on mouser), as well as the rf chip. I think I'm probably going to wait on the rf chip and just do that on a separate board (I don't want to mess with rf black magic, and the lr2021 isn't even released yet).

Finally, I reorganized the schematic so each major part was on its own sheet, since my main sheet was getting really crowded.
