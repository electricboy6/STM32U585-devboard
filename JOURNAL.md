## 10/13/2025 5 PM - Started making the schemcatic  

I started to make the schematic for my board. It's taking way longer than I though it would, partially because there's just so many darn decoupling capacitors! It's really annoying. It didn't help that there's a 350 page datasheet that I have to read for the microcontroller I'm using. I also have no idea whatsoever if I'm doing this correctly, so that's going to be fun when I realize that it's all wrong.

Here's the work I got done so far:
![startedSchematic.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjEwNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a5f4a7a04aa5233d9e314a0c24db584d44dcfc45/startedSchematic.png)

I also had to learn how to use KiCad and everything, since this is my first hardware project ever. I probably picked something a bit too ambitious.

Oh by the way I worked for about an hour before making the project on here, so that's why there's the time discrepancy.
  

## 10/13/2025 8 PM - Worked on reading docs more, also worked more on schematic  

I finally got dark mode in KiCad working (my eyes are better already), and I worked some on figuring out what oscillator to use and how to hook it up. I've also decided that I'm going to redo the boot circuit, since I don't want to use a switch and instead want to use a button. I ran out of time tonight to do that, so I'm calling it here.
Here's part of the schematic (now in dark mode!):

## 10/23/2025 12 PM - Started to add in the sensors  

Well, I started to add in the sensors to the schematic. That is making it way bigger and kind of hard to fit everything, but it'll be ok I guess. I'm denfinitely going to need someone to review this schematic before I start routing, because this is my first time making a pcb, like I said earlier. I mostly know what I'm doing, but I don't know if it's correct. It's been really hard to read the datasheet for the stm, because each pin does so many things and it's hard to figure out which pin is the right one for what I need. For example, i2c1_sda seems to be lots of different pins but none of them are dedicated to being i2c1_sda? Is there something I'm going to need to do to make it use the pin as i2c1_sda? I don't know, and that's worrying me.

I'm pausing for a bit while I lock in on my homework.

Here's what my schematic looks like now:

## 10/23/2025 3 PM - Git integration + started mostfet work  

I'm getting it set up so that I can do this on my laptop while we're driving, so I should be able to make a bunch of progress then. This is also a test to see if my journal gets fixed, since its currently empty (??).
Git was going absolutely crazy while I was doing it (I've actually never used cli git before, I'm spoiled by JetBrains).

## 10/23/2025 9 PM - Spent way too much time trying to figure things out  

I've been working on the mosfet control for the pyro channels, and I spent like 1-1.5 hours trying to figure out how to do it. Thanks to scooter y for actually helping me figure it out, and I also worked on part selection a bit. I had originally planned the project for being just a devboard, but I realized I would run out of time to make the actual flight computer if I didn't just do it now. Because of that, some of my original parts (ldo especially) won't work, and I need to pick new ones.
Here's the new mosfet schematics:
![mosfets.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDk1MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5fde6f1260f21c6d04f90d8825a0860457048932/mosfets.png)
  

## 10/26/2025 9 AM - Switched regulators, researched crystals and rf, organized  

Since I switched to just making the flight computer, the original ldo wasn't going to work (not a high enough max voltage input), so I switched to a switching power supply (mpm3610).

![newregulator.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTcwOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a99760a4d11d7d6de69536486b96f5bcbb93df3a/newregulator.png)

I also worked on researching which crystals I'm going to need to use (4mHz and 32.768kHz, figuring out the actual part on mouser), as well as the rf chip. I think I'm probably going to wait on the rf chip and just do that on a separate board (I don't want to mess with rf black magic, and the lr2021 isn't even released yet).

Finally, I reorganized the schematic so each major part was on its own sheet, since my main sheet was getting really crowded.

Main sheet

## 10/26/2025 8 PM - Holy crap hardware is hard - worked on schem and pcb  

I got the schematic all the way done (for now at least), assigned footprints, and started laying out the pcb. Holy crap laying those sensors out was awful, and I now have a lot more respect for all of the hardware nerds in HC. The main really hard part was getting the accelerometers/gyro chips routed - they're nearly overlapping (kind of have to, so the axes make sense). I actually used all 4 layers of the pcb to get that routed - using part of my power and ground layers for the signals.
Here's what the pcb looks like so far (I still have the mosfets to route - that's going to be an adventure):
![wholepcb_started](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTg3NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--865253030054a686e14c2b82bf5051d1db28a810/wholepcb_started.png)

And here's that awful area:
![theawfularea](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTg3NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b8b562422de1e67425281e3eb880f5eb17a4536e/theawfularea.png)


Btw the reason this took so long was because this is the first pcb I've ever done, and I probably picked a bit of a complicated design to start with. Oh well.
  

## 11/9/2025 - Redid like half the schematic  

I know it doesn't look like I did much, but I redid a lot of my sensor choices (they were suboptimal), and I cleaned stuff up a lot more. I switched the secondary imu to be the same as the primary, and I'm using a new magnetometer that's much more accurate (and not so small that I wouldn't be able to physically put it on the board, so that's good).
![sensorspage](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTkzOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ee1aa5c68cd582f7ee0b2c5ff0b1ffb3dc8b212c/sensorspage.png)


One small, but very important thing that I did was switch from buttons to jumpers for boot and reset, since you wouldn't really want the reset button to get "pressed" midflight.

The main thing that was completely overhauled was the mosfet area, where there's now one main p channel for arming all of the channels, then an individual n channel per pyro channel for firing. It's much simpler and more cost effective than my previous choice.

![mainoverhaul](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTkzNSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--42f269b3c80f56495e321551b30e46279d8f4281/mainoverhaul.png)

I also started the rf design part (mainly research at this point). I had to make my own (very bad and partially incomplete) symbol for the lr2021 (below).
![lr2021 symbol](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTkzNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--15dbd30b64098dcf436023f262b9c2953ce7ab0c/lr2021%20symbol.png)

Unfortunately, there are LITERALLY NO COMPONENT VALUES on the reference design, and the design looks like it's in 144p so you CAN'T READ ANYTHING AAAAAAHHHH (i'm dying internally).

Finally, I also redid my pin allocations, which are now much cleaner.
